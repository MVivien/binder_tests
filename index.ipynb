    "This notebook uses a Python environment with a few libraries, including `dask`, all of which were specificied using a `conda` [environment.yml](../edit/environment.yml) file. To demo the environment, we'll show a simplified example of using `dask` to analyze time series data, adapted from Matthew Rocklin's excellent repo of [dask examples](https://github.com/blaze/dask-examples) â€” check out that repo for the full version (and many other examples)."
